# Tek2_HUB_PROJECT

This is the Hub Project that AlexanderProsch(https://github.com/AlexanderProsch) and i worked on during our second year at Epitech.

It is a small reinterpretation of the myrpg project we did in our first year.
But this time we used the unity engine instead of the csfml library.
